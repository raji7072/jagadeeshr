<p>What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet 
with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical 
data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power,
storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).
</p>
<p>Organizations of every type, size, and industry are using the cloud for a wide variety of use cases,
such as data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, 
big data analytics, and customer-facing web applications. For example, healthcare companies are using 
the cloud to develop more personalized treatments for patients. Financial services companies are using 
the cloud to power real-time fraud detection and prevention. And video game makers are using the cloud to deliver online games to millions of players around the world.
